This repository serves as a technical test for the Machine Learning Engineer at Kitabisa.com.

Create user recommendations using the Amazon dataset, more precisely the ratings data in the AMAZON_FASHION, All_Beauty, and Luxury_Beauty categories. The category was chosen because it was felt to be close, so that the user who gave the assessment was not much different. This is also because the data is too large so that the internet connection is unable to download all the data (sorry).

Recommendations are made with an Artificial Neural Network with the input nodes are reviewerID and productID, then predict the rating value (in the python file it is called weight).
